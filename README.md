# Color-er-Using-JS-to-validate-HTML-Forms
Pick a color and i'll return matching tones and shades
<p>
I started this project because I was reading about form vaildation and over-all web validation using JS. 
<p> In the process I discovered two HTML input element's that I wasn't familiar with... They made me kind of excited so I said let's create 
something to practice form validation with.  <p>
I was able to create a widget that will help me with web design. In webdesign we need to create color schemes.
I find that website color combos are safely created by choosing a color value and grabbing a secound color value, a ligher one, by droping the opacity of that color over a white background.
