# Color-er-Using-JS-to-validate-HTML-Forms
Pick a color and I'll return matching tones and shades.
<p>
I started this project because I was reading about form vaildation and over-all web validation using JS. 
<p> In the process I discovered two HTML input element's that I wasn't familiar with... They made me kind of excited so I said let's create 
something to practice form validation with. I believe the hardest part of this process was creating a series of functions that take an RGB value, return an RGBA value, and then make the RGBA value into a Hexcode. I printed the hexcode onto an HTML element so that the user can easily grab the value from the colors they create.  <p>
I was able to create a widget that will help me with web design. In web design we need to create color schemes.
I find that website color combos are safely created by choosing a color value and grabbing a secound color value, a ligher one, by droping the opacity of that color over a white background.

 Pick a color with the color picker and I'll return tones and shades with the handle bar.
