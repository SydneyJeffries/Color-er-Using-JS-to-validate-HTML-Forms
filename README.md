# Color-er-Using-JS-to-validate-HTML-Forms
    
 Pick a color and I'll return matching tones/shades, hexacodes and show you some inspiration for your theming.<p>
    
I was able to create a widget that will help me with web design. In web design we need to create color schemes. I find that website color combos are safely created by choosing a color value and grabbing a second color value, a lighter one, by dropping the opacity of that color over a white background. <p>
    
I started this project because I was reading about form validation and over-all web validation using JS. In the process I discovered two HTML input elements that I wasn't familiar with... The range and the color picker are neat tools, so I said "let's create something to practice form validation with." I believe the most rewarding part of this process was creating a series of functions that take an RGB value, return an RGBA value, and then make the RGBA value into a Octixcode. Yes , it's a hexacode with 8 numbers and it still works for color rendering on most browsers. I printed the Coincide onto an HTML element so that the user can easily grab the value from the colors they create.

 Pick a color with the color picker and I'll return tones, shades, hexacodes and show you color theme inspiration. <a href="http://www.squid-inc.org/Color-ER"> View it on my new website :) </a>

<p> ** no need for bootstrap or any frame works in this project. I usually don't struggle with making things responsive in pure CSS. 
 I took a mobile first approach, started the styles for smaller screen sizes at the top of my style sheet and included a single media query for bigger screens.
