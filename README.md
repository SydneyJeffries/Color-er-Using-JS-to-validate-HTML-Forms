# Color-er-Using-JS-to-validate-HTML-Forms
Pick a color and I'll return matching tones/shades, hexcodes and show you some inspiration for your themeing.
<p>

I was able to create a widget that will help me with web design. In web design we need to create color schemes.
I find that website color combos are safely created by choosing a color value and grabbing a secound color value, a ligher one, by droping the opacity of that color over a white background. 
    
<p> I started this project because I was reading about form vaildation and over-all web validation using JS. 
In the process I discovered two HTML input elements that I wasn't familiar with... They made me kind of excited so I said "let's create 
something to practice form validation with." I believe the most rewarding part of this process was creating a series of functions that take an RGB value, return an RGBA value, and then make the RGBA value into a Hexcode. I printed the hexcode onto an HTML element so that the user can easily grab the value from the colors they create.

 Pick a color with the color picker and I'll return tones, shades, hexcodes and show you color theme inspiration.<a href="http://www.squid-inc.org/Color-ER"> View it on my new website :) <a> <p>
